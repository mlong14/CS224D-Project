it	O
has	O
worked	O
great	O
every	O
timea	O
great	O
buy	O
for	O

i	O
was	O
eventually	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
the	O

to	O
install	ASP
and	O
cooperate	O
with	O
the	O
samsung_alias	O
DG,	O
but	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
actually	O
connected	O
it	O
would	O
only	O
let	O
me	O
see	O
the	O
music	O
folders	O
on	O
the	O

i	O
like	O
the	O
concept	ASP
of	O
usb	O
hookup	O
to	O
the	O

for	O
the	O
price	O
and	O
length	O
however	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
nice	O
cable	ASP

the	O
cable	ASP
is	O
long	O
enough	O
to	O
work	O
in	O
situations	O
outside	O
the	O
home,	O
and	O
is	O
effective	O
in	O
every	O

i	O
lost	O
my	O

this	O
replacement	O
works	O
fine	O

im	O
all	O
up	O

maybe	O
the	O

and	O
this	O

fits	O
in	O
my	O

this	O
looks	O
more	O

a	O

from	O

i	O

it	O
that	O
often	O
now,	O
as	O
the	O

i	O
still	O
use	O
it	O
when	O
i	O

need	O
to	O

this	O

the	O

the	O
size	ASP

the	O

even	O
though	O
the	O

DGDGDGDG	O

so	O
we	O
stopped	O

it	O
immediately	O
sadly,	O
the	O

was	O

that	O

that	O

the	O

this	O

i	O
would	O

it	O
means	O
$DG	O
in	O

each	O

you	O
want	O
to	O
use	O
the	O

we	O
first	O
bought	O
an	O
argus	O
dcDGDGDGDG,	O
but	O
the	O
picture	O
quality	ASP
was	O
so	O
bad,	O
it	O
wasnt	O
worth	O
the	O
money	O
he	O
paid	O
for	O
it	O

the	O
other	O
problem	O
is	O
the	O
memory	ASP

will	O

keep	O
the	O

whenever	O

even	O

a	O

had	O
the	O

for	O
a	O
few	O
years,	O
and	O
bought	O
a	O
new	O
computer	O
with	O

another	O
great	O
thing	O
about	O
the	O

that	O

with	O
this	O

is	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
change	O
the	O

thru	O
the	O

while	O
the	O
camera	ASP

for	O

it	O
does	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
basic	O

so	O
if	O
you	O

you	O

it	O
without	O

the	O

that	O

the	O

this	O
is	O
my	O

DG	O
months,	O
the	O

using	O

at	O
the	O

the	O

its	O

if	O
you	O

then	O
buy	O

some	O
reviewers	O
seem	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
poor	O

is	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
small	O

of	O
the	O

but	O
on	O

DGDGDG	O

i	O
was	O

of	O
this	O
when	O
i	O
brought	O
it,	O

i	O
thought	O
that	O

and	O
maybe	O

a	O

i	O
got	O
this	O

a	O

i	O

the	O

the	O

for	O
this	O

all	O

but	O
the	O
most	O

and	O
the	O

that	O
the	O

this	O

this	O

the	O

i	O

the	O

the	O

the	O

this	O

with	O
a	O

this	O

the	O

the	O

blown	O
up	O
to	O

its	O
surprising	O
how	O

the	O

are	O

then	O
the	O
second	O

of	O
the	O

i	O
put	O

and	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
get	O
my	O
camera	ASP
fixed	O
for	O
a	O
cost	ASP
of	O
DGDG	O
dollars	O

my	O
camera	ASP
is	O
not	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
more	O
expensive	O
one,	O
so	O
i	O
dont	O
expect	O
mych	O
out	O
of	O
it	O

its	O
a	O
good	O
cheap	O
camera,	ASP
it	O
has	O
DGDGDG	O
speed	ASP
film	O
in	O
it	O
so	O
it	O
will	O
work	O
all	O
day	O
even	O
in	O
cloud	O
weather,	O
and	O
it	O
can	O
even	O
work	O
inside	O
but	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
very	O
well	O
light	O

than	O
a	O
real	O

definately	O
be	O
sticking	O
to	O
the	O

we	O
took	O
DG	O

them	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
DG	O
started	O
leaking,	O
completely	O

the	O

all	O

my	O

really	O
care	O
but	O
if	O

it	O
would	O
have	O
turned	O
into	O
a	O
huge_disappointment	O

a	O
waterproof	ASP
camera	ASP

many	O
years_ago	O
i	O
used	O
kodaks	O
version	O
of	O
waterproof	ASP
DGDGmm	O
cameras	ASP
and	O
the	O
picture	O
quality	ASP
was	O
DGDG	O
times	O
better	O

if	O
youre	O
not	O
lower	O
than	O
DGDGft,	O
then	O
this	O
camera	ASP
is	O
ok	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
easier	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
digital	O
camera	ASP
so	O
i	O
could	O
know	O
ahead	O
of	O
time	O
which	O
ones	O
were	O
worth	O
printing	O

the	O
camera	ASP
was	O
open	O
when	O
i	O

it	O

i	O
took	O
DG	O
of	O
these	O
on	O
a	O
trip	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O
to	O
surf	ASP
and	O
snorkel	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
negative_reviews	O
about	O
these	O
cameras	ASP
are	O
from	O
people	O
that	O
dont	O
understand	O
cameras	ASP

my	O
wife	O
and	O
i	O
bought	O
DG	O
of	O
these	O
cameras	ASP
for	O
our	O
trip	O
to	O
st_maarten	O

grainier	O
than	O
digital	O
but	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
reality	O
of	O
film	O
cameras	ASP

if	O
you	O
can	O
remember	O
the	O
DGDGmm	O
camera	ASP
taking	O
days	O
you	O
will	O
understand	O
exactly_what	O

photos	O

that	O
cheaper	O
rolls	O
of	O
DGDGDG	O
speed	ASP
film	O
that	O
one	O
could	O
buy	O
for	O
their	O
DGDGmm	O
cameras	ASP
back	O
then	O

the	O
quality	ASP
does	O
not	O
compare	O
to	O
a	O
digital	O
camera	ASP
but	O
who_cares,	O
it	O
takes	O
pics	O
underwater	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
price	O

but	O
better	O
than	O
losing	O
your	O
digital	O
camera	ASP

we	O
went	O
snorkling	O
and	O
paid	O
our	O
guide	O
$DGDG	O
to	O
take	O
pictures	O
for	O
us	O
with	O
his	O
digital	O
camera	ASP

i	O
took	O
the	O
camera	ASP
all	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
DGDGft	O
where	O
it	O
didnt	O
work	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
pressure	O
but	O
at_least	O
it	O
didnt	O
leak	O

i	O
bought	O
DG	O
units	O
of	O
this	O
disposable	O
camera	ASP
once	O
holidaying	O
in	O
fiji	O
islands	O

i	O
picked	O
up	O
pretty	O
good	O
color	ASP

as	O
it	O
turned	O
out,	O
we	O
saw	O
lots	O
of	O
sea_turtles	O
and	O
the	O
camera	ASP
far	O
exceeded	O
my	O
expectations	O

wish	O
i	O
had	O
held	O
out	O
for	O
a	O
camera	ASP
with	O
a	O
flash	O

perhaps	O
i	O
am	O
just	O
spoiled_by	O
digital_cameras	O
now	O
though	O

the	O
colors	ASP
are	O
outrageously	O
rich,	O
even	O
the	O
deeperunderwater	O
shots	O
have	O
very	O
good	O
colors	ASP
throughout	O

i	O
believe	O
the	O
camera	ASP
takes	O
DGDG	O
shots	O

we	O
had	O
no	O
idea	O
waterproof	ASP
digital	O
camera	ASP
even	O
existed	O
before	O
seeing	O
others	O
with	O
them	O
on	O
our	O

and	O
have	O
since	O
purchased	O
one	O

made	O
the	O
mistake	O
of	O
taking	O
this	O
camera	ASP
on	O
a	O
trip	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
barrier_reef	O

dont	O
buy	O
this	O

so	O
the	O
color	ASP
quality	ASP
on	O
your	O

will	O
not	O
be	O
great	O

if	O
youre	O
a	O
scuba_diver,	O
rest_assured	O
this	O
camera	ASP
is	O
pretty	O
awesome	O
for	O
the	O

i	O
used	O
the	O
camera	ASP
while	O
snorkeling	O
in	O
cancun,	O
and	O
only	O
three	O

even	O
produced	O

these	O
disposable_cameras	O
has	O
a	O
view_finder,	O
easy	O
to	O

and	O

we	O
took	O

of	O
these	O

on	O
our	O

to	O
mexico	O
and	O
captured	O
some	O

this	O

a	O
great	O
product	O

i	O
maybe	O
got	O
one	O
usable	O

the	O

the	O

the	O
qulaity	O
of	O

these	O

im	O

i	O

after	O

the	O

i	O

the	O

another	O

the	O
case	O
on	O
these	O
didnt	O
not	O

the	O

waterproof	ASP
cameras	ASP
are	O
great	O
for	O

the	O

worked	O
fine	O
but	O
not	O
a	O
single	O

was	O
worth	O

great	O

for	O
the	O

just	O
not	O
a	O
nice	O
way	O
to	O

have	O
a	O

digital	O
underwater	O
camcorder	ASP
which	O
also	O

albeit_slowly	O

cameras	ASP
did	O
remind	O

of	O
the	O

as	O
they	O
require	O
you	O
to	O

value	O
for	O
DG	O

the	O

it	O

the	O

some	O

it	O

its	O
not	O
the	O
best	O
looking	O
remote	ASP
youll	O
ever	O
find	O
but	O
the	O
design	ASP
is	O
made	O
practical	O
to	O
fit	O
the	O
strap	O

there	O
is	O
a	O
strap	O
lock	O
that	O
comes	O
with	O
it	O
so	O
you	O
can	O
clip	O
it	O
to	O
your	O
camera	ASP
strap	O
too	O

small	O
and	O
clips	O
to	O
your	O
cameras	ASP
strap	O

it	O
is	O
small	O

lightweight,	O
so	O
it	O
hangs	O
nicely	O
on	O
the	O
camera	ASP
strap	O
without	O
being	O
obvious	O
or	O
bulky	O

i	O
like	O
it	O
for	O
its	O

fact	O

however,	O
i	O

this	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
type	O
of	O
remote	ASP
that	O

my	O

on	O

i	O
have	O

the	O

that	O
its	O
good	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
just	O
a	O

it	O
appears	O
that	O
this	O

the	O

the	O

i	O
love	O
this	O

a	O
little	O
cheap	O
feeling	O
very	O
lightweight	O

but	O
it	O
has	O
a	O

use	O
your	O

the	O

that	O

the	O

pretty	O
much	O
directly	O

certanily	O
not	O
an	O

the	O
fact	O
that	O
it	O

this	O

one	O

it	O
should	O
be	O
included	O

the	O

that	O
you	O
must	O
have	O
the	O
remote	ASP
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
camera	ASP
to	O
work	O
because	O
that	O
is	O
where	O
the	O

is	O

the	O
price	O
is	O
great	O
concidering	O
the	O
functionality	ASP

my	O
first	O
reaction	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
buy	O
another	O
rcDG	O
i	O
was	O
fully	O
prepared	O
to	O
just	O
chalk	O
it	O
up	O
to	O
experience	ASP
and	O
spend	O
the	O
$DGDG	O

this	O
remote	ASP
enables	O
me	O
to	O
activate	O
the	O

without	O

the	O

i	O
use	O
this	O
remote	ASP
all	O
the	O
time	O

my	O
camera	ASP
is	O
a	O
canon_rebel	O
xsi	O
and	O
the	O
remote	ASP
was	O
easy	O
to	O
setup	ASP
and	O
has	O
worked	O
every	O
time	O

it	O
works	O
great	O
for	O
that	O
and	O
as	O
a	O
remote	ASP
switch	O
for	O
my	O
hobby	O
night	O
photography	O

ive	O
no	O
experience	ASP
with	O
other	O
remotes	ASP
so	O
this	O
one	O
meets	O
all	O
expectations	O

the	O
range	ASP
is	O
good	O
but	O
doesnt	O
work	O
as	O
well	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
at	O
a	O
steep_angle	O
to	O
the	O

as	O
with	O
any	O
ir	O

i	O
guess	O

this	O
remote	ASP
shutter	O

is	O
quite	O
nice	O
and	O
easy	O
to	O
use	O

also	O
on	O
my	O
camera	ASP
the	O
remote	ASP
setting	O
is	O
selftimer/remote	O
so	O
when	O
i	O
use	O
the	O

it	O
actually	O
starts	O
the	O
selftimer	O
making	O
it	O
difficult	O
to	O
take	O

i	O
was	O

old	O

it	O

this	O

if	O

fact,	O
the	O

a	O
lot	O
better	O
than	O
this	O

the	O
bad	O
thing	O
about	O
the	O

is	O
that	O
if	O
you	O

press	O
it	O
within	O
ten_seconds,	O
the	O

goes	O

the	O

a	O

the	O

the	O

that	O

most	O

after	O

my	O
