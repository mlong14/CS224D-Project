only	O
reason	O

a	O

there	O

the	O

it	O

this	O

i	O
always	O
keep	O

one	O

i	O
own	O
three	O

the	O

it	O

what	O
its	O

the	O

that	O
you	O

that	O

the	O
only	O

that	O

one	O

in	O
terms	O
of	O
quality	ASP
for	O
under	O
$DGDGDGDG	O

is	O
pretty	O
good	O

although	O
the	O
pictures	O
i	O
took	O
while	O
the	O
camera	ASP
worked	O
were	O
of	O
fairly	O
high	O
quality	ASP
and	O
i	O
love	O
the	O
aps_film	O
options,	O
this	O
camera	ASP
itself	O
is	O
of	O
poor	O
quality	ASP
and	O
its	O
a	O
good	O
thing	O
its	O
been	O
discontinued	O

im	O
not	O
likely	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
kodak	O

again	O

i	O
previously_owned	O
a	O
kodak	O
aps	O
camera,	ASP
which	O
was	O
recently	O

so	O
i	O
decided	O
to	O
purchase	O
another	O
kodak	O
camera	ASP

the	O
zoom	O
is	O
also	O
a	O
good	O
feature	ASP
to	O
have	O

thankfully,	O
the	O
direction	O
manual	O
is	O
easy	O
to	O
comprehend,	O
as	O
is	O
the	O
actual	O

i	O
just	O
got	O
the	O

back,	O
and	O
im	O
amazed	O
at	O
the	O
superior	O
quality,	ASP
especially	O
considering	O
the	O
low	O
price	O
of	O
the	O
camera	ASP

the	O
negatives	O
are	O
stored	O
in	O
the	O
film	O
cassett,	O
and	O
they	O
can	O
be	O
stored	O
in	O
a	O
booklike	O

so	O
that	O
i	O
can	O
easily	O
find	O
the	O

when	O
i	O
want	O
them,	O
and	O
i	O
really	O
like	O
the	O
widescreen_format	O
of	O
the	O

it	O
proably	O
costs	ASP
twice	O
as	O
much	O
to	O
use	O
the	O
aps_film	O
vs	O
DGDG	O
mm,	O
but	O
i	O
think	O
its	O
well	O
worth	O
the	O
extra	O
money	O
how	O
much	O
does	O
one	O

this	O

a	O

this	O

i	O

this	O
handsome	O
camera	ASP
takes	O
beautiful	O
classic,	O
horizontal,	O

panoramic_shots	O

***usually,	O
i	O
use	O

if	O
your	O

i	O
have	O
never	O

i	O
really	O
did	O
my	O

before	O
buying	O
a	O

the	O

everything	O
at	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
unable	O
to	O

or	O
anything	O

i	O
really	O
love	O
this	O

i	O
used	O

before	O
i	O
decided	O
to	O
go_ahead	O
and	O
buy	O
a	O
real	O
camera	ASP

it	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
good,	O
sturdy	O
little	O
camera	ASP
especially	O
for	O
its	O
price	O

i	O
received	O
this	O
camera	ASP
as	O
a	O
present,	O
probably	O
becuase	O
of	O
its	O
inexpensive	O
price	O

i	O
enjoy	O
the	O
contrast	ASP
and	O
easy	O
focus	O
now	O
and	O
then	O

if	O
they	O
keep	O
the	O

quality	ASP
up,	O
you	O
can	O
definitely	O
see	O
more	O
detail	O
with	O
than	O
without	O

i	O
decided	O
on	O
these	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
small	O
size	ASP
and	O
great	O
reviews	O

the	O
attached	O

seems	O
a	O

that	O

anything	O
i	O
really	O

was	O

at	O
how	O
inexpensive	O
these	O
are,	O
yet	O
the	O

appears	O
to	O
be	O
excellent	O

i	O
bought	O
them	O
to	O
use	O
for	O

where	O
standard	O

for	O
less	O

$DGDG	O
you	O
get	O
a	O

they	O

they	O

i	O
find	O
it	O

these	O

the	O

these	O

a	O

of	O

size	ASP

they	O
fold	O
up	O
to	O
a	O

they	O

the	O

the	O

the	O

allowed	O

i	O
take	O

i	O

that	O

the	O

the	O

i	O
take	O

processedthe	O
only	O
reason	O
i	O
would	O
not	O
give	O

the	O

and	O
it	O

so	O
much	O

develop	O

you	O

them	O
inherent	O

a	O

i	O
recommend	O
against	O
using	O

the	O

an	O

i	O

buy	O

this	O

pulled	O
up	O
these	O

with	O
much	O
better	O

than	O
either	O
of	O
our	O

radio/cd_players	O

the	O
transistor_radio	O
is	O
of	O
supereior	O

it	O
sounds	ASP
like	O
a	O
a	O

that	O

at	O
a	O
price	O

the	O

the	O

i	O
purchased	O

if	O
you	O
want	O
something	O
with	O
a	O
better	O

get	O
a	O

sonyDG	O
the	O

however	O

that	O

there	O

they	O
always	O

i	O
figured	O

i	O
should	O
buy	O

i	O
got	O
these,	O
which	O
are	O

good	O

good	O

but	O
after	O
about	O

one	O

nothing	O

that	O

i	O

i	O

i	O

the	O

the	O

if	O

i	O
was	O

at	O

because	O
of	O

that	O

a	O

my	O
dad	O
was	O
wanting	O
a	O
zoom	O

for	O
his	O

so	O
i	O
bought	O
this	O
for	O
him	O
as	O
a	O

now	O
that	O
im	O
more	O

i	O
needed	O
something	O

some	O

i	O
can	O
now	O
get	O
awesome	O

i	O
wouldnt	O
have	O
even	O

out	O

i	O

virtually	O
all	O

i	O
am	O
more	O

to	O

it	O
would	O
cost	ASP
almost	O
as	O

so	O
it	O
basically	O
was	O

i	O
certainly	O
was	O
not	O

the	O
DGDGDGDGDGmm	O
which	O
is	O
a	O

all	O
around	O

id	O

that	O
anyone	O
that	O

look	O

there	O
are	O
several	O

for	O

the	O

is	O
that	O
your	O

that	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
several	O
hundreds	O
of	O

i	O
took	O
with	O
it,	O
only	O
a	O

definitely	O

built	O
seemed	O
ok,	O
but	O
i	O
didnt	O
find	O
it	O
very	O
easy	O
to	O
use	O

its	O
not	O
because	O
of	O
this	O
particular	O
camera,	ASP
but	O
in	O
general	O
when	O
you	O
are	O
swimming	O
and	O
shaking	O
on	O
the	O
surface	O
of	O
water,	O
its	O
very	O
difficult	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
you	O
are	O
capturing	O
through	O
the	O
viewfinder	O

the	O
strap	O
was	O
great	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
hold	O
onto	O
the	O
camera	ASP
much	O
easier	O

these	O
are	O
definitely	O
cheaper	O
other	O
places,	O
but	O
for	O
a	O
working	O
mom	O
like	O
me,	O
having	O
it	O
delivered	O
to	O
the	O
door	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
two	O
days	O
was	O
definitely	O
worth	O
the	O
few	O
extra	O
bucks	O
spent	O
here	O
versus	O
a	O
big	O
box	O
storei	O
think	O
ill	O
invest	O
in	O
a	O
cheap,	O
small	O
digital	O

for	O
the	O
future	O

instead	O
of	O

on	O
a	O

we	O

we	O
have	O

and	O
cant_wait	O
to	O
use	O
them	O
for	O
our_honeymoon	O
in	O
hawaii	O

all	O
in	O
all,	O
it	O
was	O
decent	O
for	O
an	O
underwater	O
camera	ASP

since	O
it	O
isnt	O
a	O
digital	O
camera,	ASP
but	O
instead	O
was	O
DGDGDG	O

film,	O
it	O
was	O
pretty	O
costly	O
to	O
develop	O

easy	O
to	O
use	O
and	O
nothing	O
to	O
lose	O
if	O
he	O

the	O

price	O
is	O

ive	O
used	O
these	O

before,	O
and	O
they	O
take	O
great	O
pictures	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O

i	O
bought	O
this	O

at	O

we	O
took	O
the	O

c	O
there	O

even	O
a	O

you	O

to	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O

a	O
underwater	O

good	O
for	O
a	O

i	O

two	O

we	O

these	O

river_rafting	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
got	O
some	O
great	O

the	O
only	O
good	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
waterproof	ASP
and	O
wont	O
break	O
when	O
dropped	O

we	O
were	O
very	O
disapointed	O
on	O
how	O
this	O

worked	O
and	O
the	O
quality	ASP
of	O

we	O
were	O
not	O

this	O

off	O
all	O
the	O

one	O

a	O
one	O

the	O

for	O
our	O

the	O

great	O

the	O

nicely	O

according	O
to	O

therefore	O
the	O

the	O

this	O

at	O
a	O

with	O
the	O

i	O
took	O
some	O
really	O
good	O

with	O
this	O

i	O

the	O

i	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
high	O
expectations	O
for	O
a	O

costing	ASP
less	O

but	O
i	O
figured	O
that	O
any	O

the	O
lady	O
at	O

said	O
that	O
not	O
many	O
underwater	O
cameras	ASP
work	O
well	O

this	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
underwater	O
camera	ASP
i	O
have	O
purchased,	O
and	O
i	O
chose	O
this	O
one	O
based	O
on	O
reviews	O
here	O

i	O
have	O
had	O
DG	O
olympus	O
underwater	O
cameras	ASP
that	O
both	O
broke	O
despite	O
careful	O
care	O

so	O
hard	O
to	O
look	O
through	O
lcd	O
screen	ASP
to	O
take	O
underwater	O
pictures	O

the	O
cost	ASP
of	O
a	O
rented	O
camera	ASP
for	O
one	O
day	O
is	O
equivalent	O
to	O
DG	O
or	O
DG	O
of	O
these,	O
but	O
you	O
wont	O
run	O
out	O
of	O
pics	O
to	O
take,	O
and	O
youll	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
results	O
as	O
you	O
go	O
so	O
if	O
youre	O

too	O
far	O
away,	O
youll	O
know	O
that	O
and	O
be	O

did	O
not	O
have	O
any	O
issues	O
with	O
leaking	O

overall	O
the	O
product	O
was	O
satisfactory,	O
but	O
renting	O
a	O
real	O
camera	ASP
may	O
be	O
a	O
better	O
option	O

im	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
defect	O
in	O
the	O
camera,	ASP
or	O
if	O
i	O
was	O
over_zealous	O
in	O
turning	O
the	O

in	O
my	O
excitment	O
of	O
the	O
event	O

considering	O
the	O
quality	ASP
of	O
the	O
developed	O

i	O
would	O
certainly	O
try	O
this	O
camera	ASP
again	O

while	O
i	O
havent	O
used	O
film	O
cameras	ASP
in	O
a	O
while,	O
im	O
still	O
positive	O
that	O
the	O
color	ASP
quality	ASP
is	O
much	O
higher	O
than	O
what	O
we	O
achievedthen	O
again,	O
you	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
pay	O
for	O
and	O
its	O
not	O
many	O

that	O
you	O
can	O
take	O

an	O

and	O
walk	O
back	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
with	O
your	O

crapi	O
dont	O
know	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
camera	ASP
or	O
the	O
developer,	O
but	O
both	O
were	O
divisions	O
of	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
is	O
irrelevant	O

great	O
buy,	O
dont	O

it	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
the	O

the	O

wasnt	O
the	O

not	O
bad	O
for	O
a	O

regardless	O
when	O
i	O
used	O
all	O

the	O

that	O

as	O
the	O

two	O
cameras	ASP
on	O

i	O
would	O

this	O
for	O
anyone	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
underwater	O

i	O
mean,	O
hawaii	O

but	O
this	O
camera	ASP
made	O
it	O
look	O
like	O
bakersfield	O

if	O
you	O
want	O
good	O
underwater_shots,	O
get	O
a	O

we	O

when	O
it	O

that	O
i	O
really	O
wanted	O
pics	O

what	O
we	O
saw	O
while	O

if	O
i	O
had	O
it	O
to	O

over	O
again,	O
i	O
would	O
have	O
spent	O
the	O
$$	O
for	O
a	O

these	O
cameras	ASP
were	O
perfect	O
for	O
our	O
recent_vacation	O

ive	O
used	O
these	O
before	O
and	O
love	O
the	O
pictures	O
this	O
camera	ASP
can	O
take,	O
but	O
do	O
be	O
aware	O
that	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
take	O
a	O

if	O
you	O
are	O
over	O
the	O

we	O
took	O
this	O

to	O
an	O
indoor	O

and	O
there	O
was	O
plenty	O
of	O
light,	O
but	O
the	O

even	O
above	O

turned	O
out	O
very	O
grainy	O

i	O
bought	O
this	O
camera	ASP
for	O
my	O
trip	O
to	O
cancun	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
amazing	O

i	O
didnt	O
even	O
bother	O
to	O
develop	O
the	O
few	O
pictures	O
that	O
i	O
had	O
taken	O
before	O
the	O
camera	ASP
quit	O
on	O
me	O
because	O
it	O
wouldnt	O
have	O
been	O
worth	O
the	O
developing	O
fee	O
just	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
they	O
turned	O
out	O

it	O
its	O
intended	O
to	O
improve	O
the	O
print	O
quality	ASP
by	O
tweaking	O
color,	ASP
contrast	ASP
and	O
so	O
on	O

however,	O
these	O
were	O
processed	O
by	O
wolf	O

and	O
are	O
unaltered	O
from	O
what	O
they	O

on	O
the	O

i	O
have	O
used	O

my	O

never	O

these	O

it	O
was	O
so	O

that	O
you	O
could	O
hardly	O
tell	O
where	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
colorful	O
fish	O
were	O
compared	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O

because	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
the	O

we	O
are	O
pleased	O
that	O
we	O
chose	O
this	O

this	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
little	O
camera	ASP
for	O
taking_pictures	O
both	O
in	O

i	O
eventually	O

that	O

about	O
DGDG	O
DGDG	O

maybe	O

when	O

this	O

and	O
install	ASP

it	O
is	O
a	O
snug_fit	O
for	O

it	O

my	O

thanks	O
to	O

i	O
would	O
definitely	O
recommend	O
painting	O
them	O
the	O
color	ASP
of	O
your	O

so	O
that	O
it	O

after	O

i	O
needed	O
to	O

some	O

DG	O
cables	ASP
in	O
a	O
conference_room,	O
including	O
going	O
down	O
from	O
a	O

and	O
around	O
a	O

these	O
DG	O
cables	ASP
fit	O
very	O
snugly,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
still	O
pretty	O
easy	O
to	O
get	O
all	O
DG	O
into	O
the	O

cDGDGDG	O

i	O
highly_recommend	O
this	O
product	O
if	O
you	O
only	O
have	O
at	O
most	O
DG	O
or	O
DG	O
cables	ASP
to	O

i	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
squeeze	O
DG	O
av	O
cables	ASP
into	O
it,	O
although	O
it	O
will	O
really	O
hold	O
about	O
DG	O

i	O
just	O
painted	O
my	O
entire	O
apartment	O
and	O
covered	O
all	O
the	O
cables	ASP

wires	O
with	O
this	O
product	O

because	O
of	O
this	O
if	O
you	O
stick	O
the	O
channel	O
to	O
the	O
wall	O
directly	O
touching	O
the	O

you	O
will	O
not	O

to	O
put	O

over	O
the	O

afterwards	O
because	O
it	O
needs	O
to	O
go	O
between	O
the	O
stick	O
of	O
wiremold	O
and	O
the	O
baseboard	O
so	O
the	O
trick	O
is	O
lay	O
a	O
thin	O
piece	O
of	O
plastic	O
above	O
the	O

DG/DGDG	O
then	O
tack	O
the	O

down	O

that	O
way	O
youll	O
have	O

go	O

for	O
at	O

after	O

it	O
at	O

i	O
think	O
its	O
a	O
great	O

for	O
the	O

especially	O
since	O
locally	O
a	O
simple	O
DG	O

a	O

is	O

right	O
now	O

i	O
might	O

that	O

that	O

both	O

these	O

the	O

also,	O
the	O

terrible,	O
about	O
DGDG	O
with	O

a	O
more	O

something	O
i	O

if	O
you	O

this	O

over	O
the	O

look	O
no	O
further	O

it	O
is	O

it	O
comes	O

but	O
instead	O

i	O
suggest	O

set	O
the	O

keep	O
the	O

what	O
i	O
didnt	O
know	O
before	O

a	O

is	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
in	O

of	O
the	O

i	O
was	O

anything	O

the	O

and	O
enable	O
the	O

quite	O
a	O
few	O

the	O

a	O

any	O

the	O

i	O
received	O
the	O

this	O
evening	O
and	O
have	O
not	O

able	O
to	O
get	O
the	O

work	O
with	O
my	O
canon_rebel	O

followed	O
the	O
directions	O
that	O
were	O

the	O

no_avail	O

this	O
remote	ASP
is	O
cheap	O
and	O
gets	O
the	O
job_done	O
well	O

i	O
just	O
wish	O
canon	O
made	O
a	O
simple	O
cheap	O
wireless	O
remote	ASP
like	O
this	O
for	O
all	O
of	O
their	O

when	O
we	O
are	O

my	O

with	O
a	O
small	O
portable	O
tripod	O
or	O

i	O
can	O
usually	O
prop	O
the	O

up	O

get	O
a	O

of	O
us	O
standing	O

bother	O
a	O

up	O
the	O

anyway	O

works	O
great,	O
attaches	O

the	O
neck	O

and	O
you	O
can	O
use	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
bulb	O
feature	ASP
for	O
extra	O
long	O
night	O
shots	O

i	O
love	O
this	O
remote,	ASP
i	O
wish	O
i	O
bought	O
it	O
sooner	O

the	O
only_complaint	O
i	O
have	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
really	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
directly	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
camera	ASP
sensor	O

if	O
you	O
plan	O
on	O
buying	O
a	O
tripod	O
and	O
setting	O
up	O
some	O
lighting	O
for	O
a	O
particular	O
shot	O
and	O
are	O
considering	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
mirror	O
locked	O
up	O
to	O
reduce	O
any	O
shake,	O
then	O
take	O
another	O
step	O
and	O
get	O
this	O
remote	ASP
triggerit	O
does	O
have	O
a	O
limited	O
range	ASP

so,	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
take	O
pictures	O
of	O
yourself	O
and	O
find	O
that	O
the	O
remote	ASP
is	O
not	O
really	O
triggering	O
the	O
shots	O
at	O
your	O
will,	O
dont	O
be	O
surprised	O

ive	O
been	O
using	O
this	O
wireless	O
remote	ASP
for	O
a	O
couple	O
years	O
now	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
great	O

you	O
can	O
also	O
use	O
it	O
when	O
you	O
have	O
the	O
shutter_speed	O
really	O
slow	O
so	O
not	O
to	O
shake	O
the	O
camera	ASP
at_allthe	O
only_downside	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
camera	ASP
so	O
the	O
lens	O
doesnt	O
block	O
the	O
sensor,	ASP
but	O
other	O
than	O
than	O
ive	O
never	O
had	O
a	O
problem	O
with	O
it	O

i	O
use	O
this	O
whenever	O
my	O
camera	ASP
is	O
on	O
a	O
tripod	O

i	O
use	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
DGd,	O
and	O
i	O
love	O
how	O
i	O
am	O
now	O
free	O
to	O
look	O
over	O
my	O
camera	ASP
at	O
my	O
subjects	O
particularly	O
children	O
to	O
build	O
rapport,	O
make	O
them	O
laugh,	O
or	O
give	O
them	O
directions,	O
ie,	O
chin	O
down,	O
etcit	O
requires	O
a	O
lineofsight	O
to	O
work,	O
so	O
i	O
do	O
have	O
to	O
curl	O
my	O
right	O
hand	O
around	O
my	O
camera	ASP
to	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
the	O
lens	O
same	O
side	O
as	O
shutter_release	O
to	O
reach	O
the	O
sensor,	ASP
but	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
problem	O

the	O
remote_control	ASP
works	O
as	O
described	O

all	O
and	O
all	O
it	O
works	O
for	O
what	O
i	O
need	O
and	O
would	O
recommend	O
it	O
to	O
photographers,who	O
need	O
a	O

remote_control	ASP

need	O
to	O

the	O

so,	O
if	O

or	O

a	O

the	O

you	O
have	O
to	O

it	O

your	O

or	O
it	O
wont	O

ive	O
had	O
really	O
good	O

with	O
this	O

this	O

them	O
in	O
a	O

then	O
this	O

i	O
use	O
the	O

with	O
a	O

and	O
its	O
nearly	O
perfect	O

sometimes	O
it	O
can	O
take	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
button	O

and	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
moving	O
the	O

around,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
a	O
great	O

to	O
your	O

maybe	O
this	O
is	O
more	O
a	O
function	O
of	O
my	O

i	O
was	O
glad	O
that	O

that	O

that	O
you	O

right	O
in	O

of	O
the	O

for	O
it	O
to	O

you	O
can	O
be	O
on	O

it	O

i	O
ordered	O
one	O
for	O

a	O

since	O
we	O
both	O
got	O
new	O

that	O

but	O
thats	O
another	O
problem	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
solved	O
by	O
a	O
wired	O

i	O
was	O
doing	O
a	O
photoshoot	O
recently	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
solemn	O

missed	O
several	O

because	O
the	O

didnt	O
pick_up	O
the	O

it	O
has	O
a	O

you	O

the	O
only	O
reason	O
im	O
rating	O
this	O

a	O

is	O
because	O

it	O

another	O

if	O

you	O

if	O

then	O
this	O

i	O

as	O
well	O
as	O

a	O

it	O

an	O

this	O

you	O

this	O

maybe	O
it	O

both	O
a	O

an	O

used	O
it	O
at	O
a	O

needed	O
it	O
for	O
taking_pictures	O

i	O
was	O

i	O
especially	O

that	O

what	O
it	O

so	O
that	O
you	O

however,	O

this	O

it	O

the	O

the	O

the	O
reason	O

because	O
the	O

the	O

thing	O

that	O

to	O

that	O

the	O

probably	O
the	O

the	O

another	O

that	O
i	O

a	O

this	O
takes	O
more	O

i	O
recommend	O
it	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
tell	O
if	O
the	O

or	O
off,	O
without	O

this	O

if	O

there	O
was	O
a	O

then	O
i	O
found	O
a	O

at	O

in	O
anaheim	O
with	O
a	O

then	O

came	O
around,	O

guys,	O
but	O
the	O

has	O
a	O

anyhow,	O
so	O
use	O
it	O

also	O
the	O

i	O

to	O
use	O
it	O
in	O
this	O

and	O
pictures	O
you	O
really	O
want	O
to	O
conserve,	O
take	O
them	O
with	O
both	O
cameras	ASP
this	O

your	O

one	O

do	O
not	O
use	O
it	O
to	O

your	O

camera	ASP

in	O
conclusion	O
i	O
say,	O
stay	O
far,	O
far	O
away	O
from	O
this	O
camera	ASP

and	O
for	O
the	O
love	O
of	O
all	O
that	O

at_least	O
get	O

it	O

anything	O

because	O

the	O

for	O
a	O

the	O

in	O
