you	O

i	O
like	O
this	O
keyboard	ASP
when	O
it	O
works	O

i	O
dont	O
know	O
how	O
this	O
keyboard	ASP
gets	O
as	O
many	O
good	O
reviews	O
as	O
it	O
got	O

i	O
dont	O
have	O
to	O
turn	O
these	O
speakers	O
up	O
too	O
loud	O
and	O
i	O
can	O
hear	O
everything	O
and	O
my	O
neighbors	O
dont	O
complain	O

great,	O
easy	O
to	O
use	O
works	O
every	O
time	O
no	O
hassles	O
just	O
plug	O

start	O

the	O
quality	ASP

fantastic	O

i	O
love	O
this	O
little	O
bag	O

i	O
originally	O
ordered	O
only	O
one	O
set	O
to	O
be	O
certain	O
it	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
work	O
especially	O
in	O
light	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
comments	O
and	O
reviews	O

we	O
really	O
like	O
the	O
short	O
cord	O
with	O
the	O
extension	O
because	O
the	O
short	O
cord	O
is	O
great	O
with	O
using	O
your	O
ipod	O
with	O
an	O
armband	O

does	O
everything	O
is	O
claims	O
very	O
well	O

for	O
faster	O
adjustments	O
there	O
are	O
levers,	O
when	O
released,	O
allow	O
for	O
free	O
movement	O
by	O
hand	O
exactly	O
like	O
a	O
three	O
way	O
headthat	O
means	O
you	O
get	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
heads,	O
precise	O
and	O
free	O
movement,	O
plus	O
much	O
more	O
including	O
very	O
small	O
adjustment_knobs	O
compared	O
to	O

this	O
is	O
the	O
reason	O
you	O
buy	O
something	O

this,	O
especially	O
if	O
you	O

the	O

the	O

the	O

very	O

i	O
am	O
a	O
freak	O
about	O

so	O
i	O
wanted	O
to	O
get	O
a	O

that	O
were	O
better	O
than	O
the	O

which	O
were	O
not	O

after	O

that	O
the	O

i	O

it	O
speaks	O
to	O
the	O
