DGDGbang for the buckDGDG this camera did not disappoint and i

screen resolution is great, computer speed is not an issue and

quality build, svelte looks, and reliability some will disagree with this

nice to not have to install any funky drivers and risk

i would buy a monster cable for my other devices in

high quality with a thicker cable that i have ever_seen

is dont ever lose the cable as its a double ended

not a problem for mevideo quality is excellent, as expected <\s>

dont bother counting pennies, this camera is underpriced at full price
