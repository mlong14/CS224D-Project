this you trade speed for quality and convenience for precision <\s>
i dont like about this design is the fact that there
000 000 000 000 <s> books, not great with high_fidelity music
not too excited about the color orange as the chosen backlightsomething
not as easy as it sounds <\s> 000 000 000 000
not sturdy enough for their weight <\s> 000 000 000 000
pricecons will not support larger cameras <\s> 000 000 000 000
it i just expected the color would be more hot_pink
i dont like is the weight <\s> 000 000 000 000
<s> i certainly expected better performance from wirelessn than i get
it doesnt properly fit the keyboard and it keeps moving and
but they make the keys backlight less visible and attractive <\s>
000 000 000 000 <s> keyboard is kinda small, but works
